        For children and young people growing up in divorced or separated families, ICTs offer a way of maintaining contact with parent/carers and enhancing parent–child relationships (Russell et al., 2021; Smyth & Fehlberg, 2019). ICTs include hardware (such as mobile phones or computers) and software (specific app or program types enabling email or video calling) and are used to communicate, share information and maintain social relationships (Baude et al., 2023). 
        Post-separation contact between parents and children often entails custody or residential arrangements where children split their time between parent/carers and may physically spend more time with one parent/carer than another. Hence, contact through ICTs, whether it be phone calls, video calls or text messages, is an important form of communication and relationship maintenance (Holt, 2016; Smyth, 2005). ICT use may be especially important when separated parent/carers live in different locations and/or children have longer periods of absence from one parent or carer.
        In the context of post-separation, children commonly use ICT to communicate with both parents (not only with the non-resident parent) (Saini et al., 2013; Saini & Polak, 2018). Parents also commonly favour ICT as a method of communication between children and/or the other (non-resident) parent (Dworkin et al., 2016). 
        For child and family practitioners planning intervention strategies that aim to enhance parent–child contact and communication, it is essential to understand the role of ICT use in post-separation communication between children and separated parent/carers. This can include knowing what digital technology types are commonly used to maintain contact and parent–child relationships and specific issues associated with such forms of contact in the context of post-separation contact. 
        This article summarises the findings of a systematic review by Baude and colleagues (2023) of studies that focused on technology facilitated communication between parents and children. Baude and colleagues (2023) reported on the use of a range of device and technology types, including email, texting, instant messaging, web cam or video conference, and the sharing of photos.
